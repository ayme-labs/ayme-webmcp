# React integration smoke app

A counter with one compiled Page Object, running beneath `AymeWebMcpProvider` in React Strict Mode. It checks the integration without duplicating the Vue inspector demo.

From the workspace root:

```sh
pnpm run build
pnpm --filter @ayme-dev/example-react dev
pnpm --filter @ayme-dev/example-react test:e2e
```

The app works without a WebMCP driver through the direct Page Object button. End-to-end tests install a recording driver, execute a generated tool, and check tool removal and restoration as the counter unmounts and mounts. Another test uses the same POM through real Playwright.

See the [React package README](../../packages/webmcp-react/README.md) for setup and lifecycle rules. SSR and Next.js remain follow-up work.
